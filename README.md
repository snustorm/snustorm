IDL stands for **Interface Definition Language**. It is a JSON file that describes the interface of your Solana smart contract, including its accounts, instructions, types, and errors.

PDA stands for **Program-Derived Address**. It is a special type of account on Solana that is generated by a program (smart contract) instead of a private key. Unlike normal accounts that are controlled by keypairs, a PDA does not have a private key and is owned by a Solana program.

CPI stands for **Cross-Program Invocation**. It is a mechanism that allows one Solana program (smart contract) to call another program within the Solana blockchain.
